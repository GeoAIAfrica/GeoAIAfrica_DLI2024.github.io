title: Code of Conduct
---

As participants in the Indaba Community, you are asked and expected to comply with the code of ethics and conduct outlined [here](https://deeplearningindaba.com/mentorship/code-of-ethics-and-conduct/#:~:text=Code%20of%20Conduct%3A%20Every%20participant,%2C%20religion%2C%20or%20socioeconomic%20status.). We ask that you recall a central principle of African philosophy, whether you know it as ujamaa (Swahili), umuntu (Chichewa), ubuntu (Zulu), unhu (Shona), djema’a (Arabic), or through the many other words used across our continent: the philosophy of familyhood and unity.

This code of conduct and ethics outlines what the expected standards of behaviour on all Indaba platforms and events are. It is every participant’s responsibility to uphold, and is how we maintain an environment that keeps everyone safe and welcome. This document consists of two parts, the Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics.

Every participant is responsible for promoting and creating a safe experience for all participants, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion, or socioeconomic status.

Our duty as an Indaba community is to create a familyhood of people and cultures and learning, built on the principles of collective personsonhood, freedom, equality and unity; and towards the aim of strengthening African machine learning. We best serve each other when we allow each other the freedom to be as we are; only on the basis of equality – between genders, nationalities or other differences – can we work together cooperatively; and when we are united as a society can we work towards the good of all.


## Code of Ethics
Every participant is tasked to comply with the following ethical principles: Contribute to society and to human well-being; Uphold high standards of scientific excellence; Avoid harm; Be honest, trustworthy and transparent; Be fair and take action to avoid discrimination; Respect the work required to produce new ideas and artefacts; Respect privacy; Honour confidentiality.


## Unacceptable Behaviour
We are committed to creating a safe experience for all participants in the Indaba Mentorship Programme, and will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled permanently at the discretion of the organisers.

Forms of harassment and discriminatory behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Sexual language and imagery,
- Sexist, racist, and exclusionary jokes, and acts that insult or belittle other participants in any way.
- Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status;
- Sharing sexual images;
- Deliberate intimidation;
- Stalking and following;
- Unwarranted photography or recording;
- Sustained disruption of event programming;
- Unwelcome sexual attention;
- In any way, creating a sexualised environment.

These acts are unacceptable at any and all Indaba events and programmes, whether organised by the Indaba organisers, sponsors of the Indaba, or by participants themselves.
