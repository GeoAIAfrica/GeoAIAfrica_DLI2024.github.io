title: The Trustworthy AI Workshop @ DeepIndaba 2022
---

### First announcement of the workshop
The Trustworthy AI Workshop will be taking place @ DeepIndaba 2022!
Trustworthy AI aims to provide explainable, robust and fair decision making process. In addition, transparency and security also play a significant role to improve the adoptability and impact of ML solutions. Particularly, data and models are often imported from external sources to address solutions in developing countries, thereby risking potential security issues. The divergence of data and model from the population at hand also poses a lack of transparency and explainability in the decision-making process. Thus,  a workshop at Deep Learning Indaba 2022 on this specific theme aims to bring researchers, policymakers, and regulators to discuss ways to ensure security and transparency while addressing fundamental problems in developing countries, particularly when data and models are imported and/or collected locally with less focus on ethical considerations and governance guidelines.
