### Keynote: Trustworthy AI as Decolonial AI by Shakir Mohamed

**Abtract:** We'll use some cases of historical stories of technology development to explore some of the dimensions of trustworthy technologies, specifically using examples of AI in water management, and climate change. These examples will expose harms that arise from algorithmic systems and part of trustworthy technologies is to consider alternative paths and actions that can be taken at individual and institutional levels. I'll explore a few topics that arise from a decolonial approach to thinking about AI and the advantages of historical hindsight in building trustworthy technology.
