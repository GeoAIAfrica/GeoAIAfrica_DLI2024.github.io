Happy to announce the [CFP](https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2022/cfp.html) of Practical Machine Learning for Developing Countries workshop at ICLR 2022.
We encourage contributions that highlight challenges of learning in low resource environments that are typical in developing countries. 

**Deadline: February 25th 12:00 AM UTC.**

Practical Machine Learning for Developing Countries (PML4DC) workshop is a full-day event that has been running regularly for the past 2 years in row at ICLR (past events include [PML4DC 2020](https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2020/) and [PML4DC 2021](https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2021/)). 
PML4DC aims to foster collaborations and build a cross-domain community by featuring invited talks, panel discussions, contributed presentations (oral and poster) and round-table mixers.
