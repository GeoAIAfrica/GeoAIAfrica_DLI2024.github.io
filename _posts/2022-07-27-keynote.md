### Keynote: Adaptive Learning with Artificial Barriers by Prof. Anis Yazidi

**Abtract:**  In this talk, we will present some new advances in reinforcement learning in which artificial barriers are imposed to confine the action probabilities in order to avoid absorbing states. We will also some of the applications of this new paradigm in multi-agent systems. Furthermore, we will show some connections between reinforcement learning and dynamical systems using the theory of two-time scale stochastic approximation. Some applications of distributed learning in sensor fusion without knowledge of ground truth will be presented.
