## The Trustworthy AI Workshop @ DeepIndaba 2022

Trustworthy AI aims to provide explainable, robust and fair decision making process. In addition, transparency and security also plays a significant role to improve the adoptability and impact of ML solutions. Particularly, data and models often imported from external sources in addressing solutions in developing countries, thereby  risking potential security issues.   The  divergence of data and model from population at hand also poses a lack of transparency and explainabilty of the decision making process. Thus,  a  workshop at Deep Indaba 2022 on this specific theme aims to bring researchers, policy makers and regulators to discuss on ways to ensure security and transparency while addressing fundamental problems in developing countries, particularly, when data and models are imported and/or collected locally with less focus on ethical consideraions and governance guidelines.
